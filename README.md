Car Plate Recognition

## Part 1: Basic Implementation
I had issues trying to set up the virtual environment like authors recommended, using the env.txt file. It complained about conflicting dependencies and what not. I ended up pip installing the requirements.txt file, but with later versions of many of the dependencies. Running the code as is (with minor tweaks) gave me following results:

## Part 2: Part 2 – Using Our New Data

### Bash script (train/test)

### DataLoader

### DataCollator

## Part 3 – Training and Evaluation

## Part 4 – Evaluation and Error Analysis
It's hard to do an error analysis if you don't have any results, but the data set struck me as fairly small. 

## Part 5 - Exploring New Architectures
Since I didn't manage to get any results with the car plates dataset, I decided to explore other architectures for the original code with the synthetic dataset.
